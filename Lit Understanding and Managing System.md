## Understanding
From https://ilyashabanov.substack.com/p/note-taking-system-for-success-in

### Sources
One note per paper or other source with:
- Metadata: 
	- DOI
	- Date
	- One sentence summary
	
- Tags.  Such as #soil, #recommendation, #impacts
- Summary
- Quotes
- PDF file with highlights
This should be short.  In a note with Author and year.  Rename and store paper with Author and year. 
### Compendiums
Collections of findings that:
- can be my own
- can be extracted from source
- short paragraph or sentence written in my own words
- includes link to source
Findings, not thoughts.  

This will be a collection of statements, e.g. in a "Soils" Obsidian Note "short fallows lead to soil erosion Smith et al. 2020".  Author-date is linked.  Use double brackets for links.

You can also have linked text where citation is first separated by a "|" with the text. 

Can have titles (headers).   Headers will become long and lead to separate Compendiums. 

### Thoughts
Idea or question, with goal of nurturing creativity.  Leads to Ontologies.

Link to sources.

Revisit often. 

### Ontologies
Formal description of concepts.  A map of how things relate to one another.  Leads to a:
- chapter in a paper 
- recommendation
Aim for publication quality writing and structure here.  Should be essentially an aggregation of facts from compendiums.
