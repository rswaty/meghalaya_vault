## To do
* get solid jhum numbers
* what are the cumulative impacts of jhum?  Is it a big deal?
* 
## Basics

- Practitioners are locally called Jhummias [[Tamuli and Bhattacharya 2025.pdf|Citation 2 in Tamuli and Bhattacsharya 2025]]
- In West Garo Hills, between 2016-2023  ([[Tamuli and Bhattacharya 2025.pdf]]):
	- ~42% of area had fallow period > 6 years
	- ~36% between 4-6 years
	- 22% <= 3 years
	- what is the total area?
- Forest Survey of India reported 1.73 million ha of forest was affected by jhum cultivation in Northeast India (as of 2000, [[Tamuli and Bhattacharya 2025.pdf|Tamuli and Bhattacharya 2025, Citation 3]] , see https://fsi.nic.in/forest-report-2023)
- National Remote Sensing Center (https://www.isro.gov.in/NRSC.html) reported ~ .76M ha was under jhum in 2008-2009 ([[Tamuli and Bhattacharya 2025.pdf|Tamuli and Bhattacharya 2025, Citation 4]])
- ~80% of people of Meghalaya are agriculturalists ([[Tamuli and Bhattacharya 2025 b|Gov of Meghalaya, 2022 Citation in Tamuli and Bhattacharya 2025b]])
- Meghalaya is ~2,242,900ha (5,542,326 acres)
