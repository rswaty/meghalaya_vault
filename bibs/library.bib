   abstract = {Jhum cultivation is the oldest farming practice approach evolved in the Neolithic period. This is also known as the slash and burn method for its process of operation. The system is considered to be the first stage in transit of human being from hunter to food gatherer to crop cultivators. In the North-East India, jhum cultivation is still prevalent in its hilly regions. It is a tradition practiced by Garo community in the West Garo Hills district of Meghalaya, India. Considering the uniqueness of the agricultural practice, this paper tries to examine its process and pattern, factors contributing persistency of jhum cultivation and alternative livelihood plans adopted by the native community over time. While jhum remains integral part of the livelihoods and cultural identity of the Garo community, concerns have emerged regarding deforestation, soil erosion, biodiversity loss, and declining agricultural productivity associated with this practice. Government policies and scientific interventions have aimed to promote sustainable alternatives such as agroforestry, mixed cropping, and improved land management techniques in the area. This study highlights the need for a balanced approach that integrates traditional ecological knowledge with modern sustainable practices, ensuring both environmental conservation and the socio-economic well-being of local farming community.},

   abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effects of different fallow periods on soil properties under jhum cultivation and also determine the minimum fallow duration required for restoring soil fertility level in the West Garo Hills District, Meghalaya. Method: Soil samples were collected from 23 jhum cultivation plots with fallow periods ranging from 1 to 15 years, along with two natural forest patches for comparison. Soil samples were obtained from a depth of 0-15 cm and analyzed for physical and chemical properties. Findings: The study revealed that longer fallow periods (7-15 years) resulted in higher proportions of fine soil particles (silt and clay), along with increased levels of organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Soil fertility was found to be lowest in areas with less than 4 years of fallow and showed significant improvement from the 7th year onward. Novelty: This study provides empirical evidence supporting the importance of extended fallow periods in restoring soil fertility under jhum cultivation. It highlights the threshold fallow duration (7-8 years) necessary to regain soil health and sustain productivity, offering critical insight for sustainable land management practices in jhum cultivation method.},

   abstract = {Shifting /jhum cultivation, is the major production system in hilly agro-ecologies of Meghalaya, leading to resource degradation, reduced crop productivity, and environmental pollution. This necessitates the implementation of a micro-watershed-based integrated farming system (IFS) with effective soil and water conservation measures. Thus, an agro-pastoral-based farming system (0.64 ha) was evaluated from 2021 to 2023, to improve system productivity , and farm income and reduce reliance on external inputs. The crop planning strategy was designed across different watershed zones: single cropping in the upper zone, double cropping in the middle, and triple cropping in the lower zone, with vertical farming to optimize land use and maximize yield. Among various enterprises, the dairy unit had the highest system production efficiency (SPE) (28.1 kg/ha/day) and system productivity (SP) (10.2 Mg/ ha), and overall, the agro-pastoral system recorded 75% and 47% greater SP than farmer practices I and II, respectively. The agro-pastoral system achieved ~85-92% greater net return, highest B:C ratio (1.67), system economic efficiency (SEE) (`414/ha/day), and employment (250 man-days) than the farmer practices. The integration of different enterprises also enhanced energy dynamics. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, the dairy unit had the highest contribution (49%), followed by maize-green gram-toria (10%), and the least in sole turmeric (6%). Additionally , the boundary tree species contributed a carbon sink of 5,707 kg CO 2 eq/yr, resulting in a positive system carbon balance of 14,635 kg CO 2 eq/yr. Thus, the adoption of an agro-pastoral system offers a suitable alternative for achieving higher resource efficiency, and economic security in the mid-hills of Meghalaya.},

   abstract = {India is a predominantly agricultural economy. More than 70% of its population is directly or indirectly involved in agricultural activities. India is one of the foremost producers of spices in the world. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), 63 spices are grown in India. Ginger is one of the main spices and plays a vital role in the production and export of the country. Meghalaya's economy is predominantly agriculture-based with 81% of its population depending on agriculture, though agricultural productivity in Meghalaya is very low. This paper analyzes resource use efficiency in ginger production in Meghalaya's West Garo Hills district. The study is based on primary data. The multi-stage random sampling technique was used to select 300 ginger farmers. To estimate resource use efficiency in ginger production, the Cobb-Douglas type of production function was best fitted to the data. Independent variables identified were land (X 1), seed (X 2), labour (X 3), harvesting cost (X 4), marketing cost (X 5) and others include hoe, dao (wait), digging spades (X 6) and dependent variables as production of ginger(Y). Among the inputs used for the production of ginger which had positive and significant influences at the overall level, the MVP to PX ratio was less than one for land (0.07), seed (0.26), human labor (0.08), harvesting cost (0.08), marketing cost (0.13) and others (0.09) indicated under-utilization of these resources in the cultivation of ginger.},

These forms of agriculture include shifting cultivation and its adaptations across com­munities in the tropics. However, the policy narra­tive around shifting cultivation is rooted in its mis­understanding, as it was once seen as primitive and backward. New research and a reinterpretation of existing research present challenges to long-held policies that have discouraged and deterred the practice of shifting cultivation. With the onset of this new narrative is a call to action that seeks a rethinking by policymakers and governance actors around the nature and merits of traditional agricul­ture. Through the case of Meghalaya, a small hilly state in the Northeastern region of India large­ly inhabited by Indigenous Peoples, this commentary aims to provide the dominant narrative at the local con­text, evidence of the adaptations in shifting cultiva­tion that contribute to sustainability, and the need to rethink policy relating to shifting cultivation at the local level.},

In Meghalaya, increasing human population density like in other states of India has resulted in the practice of unsustainable form of jhum that includes shortening of the fallow period of jhum cycle. This unsustainable form of jhum cultivation leads to soil degradation, soil erosion, loss of forest vegetation and threatens the survival of valuable flora and fauna. The study area is one of the richest reservoirs of plant diversity of NorthEast India as well as India. The decreasing fallow period from 15-20 to 2-3 years has a negative impact on the environment sustainability in Meghalaya which reduced the quality of soil. The overall reduction in the forest, mainly due to jhumming can severely affect the viable forest habitat of the endangered fauna.

   abstract = {Agricultural and forestry activities can affect soil organic carbon (SOC) levels and CO2 emissions from terrestrial ecosystems due to land use changes. In Northeast Himalayas, studies on the effects of forest conversion to temporary agricultural lands (jhum) on the loss of SOC and soil quality degradation have received the attention of policy makers and scientific research. Presently, local communities are now oriented towards the settled plantations systems with modern cash crops such as tea and rubber, that could act as potential SOC sinks. However, no information on SOC dynamics and simulation studies after land-use change from temporary agricultural lands (jhum) to settled cultivations and under climate change (CC) conditions are available for the Meghalaya state. Applying the RothC model, we focused on four different scenarios including the conversion from jhum to settled cultivation (rubber plantations and tea gardens), as well as continuous jhum cultivation and jhum to jhum with a period of secondary succession. Simulations under CC conditions indicated that SOC stocks significantly increased by 1.20 t C ha−1 yr−1 in tea gardens compared to rubber and jhum scenarios. Conversely, SOC stocks slightly decreased by 0.07 t C ha−1 yr−1 in rubber plantations, while the regrowth of a natural vegetation cover as secondary succession following the abandonment of the jhum fields, showed a lower SOC decrease (0.18 t C ha−1 yr−1) compared to the continuous jhum cultivation (0.24 t C ha−1 yr−1). Thus, for CC mitigation in a policy perspective, tea gardens could represent the best land use to store increasing amounts of SOC in the long-term perspective and optimize farmers' incomes, while in rubber plantations SOC storage is limited in time. Jhum cultivation can benefit in terms of productivity and profitability by extending the duration of the secondary succession period.},

In the present study, different pools of soil organic C were assessed, from shifting cultivation lands (jhum), rubber, tea garden and coffee plantations of Tura district in Meghalaya, which is located in Northeastern region (NER) of India. To achieve this goal, different parameters such as bulk density (BD), total organic carbon (TOC) and C pools, viz., very labile (CVL), labile (CL), less labile (CLL) and non-labile (CNL) were analyzed. The results indicated signiﬁcant correlations among TOC and C pools in most land uses, except for CNL pool. Tea gardens showed the highest value of TOC stock (62.75 ± 1.47 t C ha−1) while the lowest was found in the jhum lands (33.34 ± 5.04 t C ha−1). Similarly, both the active (12.03 mg g−1) and passive (4.60 mg g−1) C pools were highest under tea gardens. CVL was found to be positively correlated with TOC and active carbon pool (ACP), while CLL was also positively correlated with passive carbon pool (PCP). This study indicates the potential of tea gardens as a promising C sequestering land use, which can be promoted in jhum lands to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.},
