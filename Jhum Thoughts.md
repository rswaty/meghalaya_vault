- [[Tamuli and Bhattacharya 2025 b]] notes 
	- exploitation of farmers (see page S333).  Listen and watch for this
	- lack of interdisciplinary efforts and resulting lack of trust with technology introductions.  May lead to #recommendation around communications
	- Could irrigated terraced benches be a #recommendation 
- are there comparisons between modern farming and jhum inputs/outputs?
- Seems like fire prevention is driving a fair bit of research, gov effort and action.  Could better fire training help reduce pressure to reduce jhum? #recommendation 
- John Den Uyl wondered about biochar #recommendation .  See ideas for "diversion and destruction of littter" in [[Chakraborty et al 2024]]
- What if there were a permitting system to better help map and understand jhum and fires
