> While jhum remains integral part of the livelihoods and cultural identity of the Garo community, concerns have emerged regarding deforestation, soil erosion, biodiversity loss, and declining agricultural productivity associated with this practice. Government policies and scientific interventions have aimed to promote sustainable alternatives such as agroforestry, mixed cropping, and improved land management techniques in the area. This study highlights the need for a balanced approach that integrates traditional ecological knowledge with modern sustainable practices, ensuring both environmental conservation and the socio-economic well-being of local farming community.




### Aim of Paper
Study process and pattern of jhum cultivation in Garo Hills, know factors contributing to persistency of jhum and study the alternative livelihood strategies adapted/possible to adapt by local community. 
### Insights
- they note "However, this agricultural system cannot meet their current needs. The residents in the study region are looking for alternative sources of income and livelihood."
- Area in Jhum is declining ([[Pandey et al 2022.pdf]] cited in this paper), though it does still persist due to:
	- simple and cheapest method.  No costs for labor, seed, fertilizer, irrigation, pesticides, etc.
	- cultural factor.  Everything is refined.  There are festivals and this is linked to community's spiritual identity
	- jhum control programs being implemented in isolation so farmers are skeptical
	- lack of financial support to try other practices
	- mixed cropping results in better nutrient use efficiency, pest management and stability
	- poor introduction of technology, and tech that does not work with local needs
- Alternative Strategy ideas presented in paper
	- Horticulture: cashew nut, areca nut, rubber plantation, pineapple, orange
	- Piggeries and chicken husbandry
	- Handloom weaving for young women
	- ==Increase preservation/storage for locals; also affordable transport and marketing to stop exploitation of farmers==
	- Value added processing in Tura Town (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tura,_Meghalaya)
	- Create bench terraces with irrigation to lure jhummias to settled ag
	- A bit cryptic, but sounds like sand and coal development is not regulated well?  Better and more sustainable approaches might be suitable as a way for locals to make money?
	- Family planning	-
