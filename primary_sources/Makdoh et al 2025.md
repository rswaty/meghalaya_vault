> ...the adoption of an agro-pastoral-based farming system helps in enhancing crop and livestock productivity due to efficient resource recycling along with greater farm profitability, and employment generation than the regional farmer practices. Besides this, crop diversification
and livestock integration also enhance energy dynamics; and amalgamation of the agroforestry component (natural forest on the hilly slope) resulted in reduced environmental footprints and created a positive carbon balance, thereby promoting a green and circular economy.




### Aim of Paper
Explored cost-benefits of a more modern agricultural system that was established in 1983 on a 0.64HA site.  Terracing was employed.  Costs of human labor, fuel, machinery, seed, residue, chemical fertilizers, fodder grass, straw, concentrated feed, water, and plant protection chemicals i.e., insecticide and fungicide, etc. was tracked alongside yield (expressed as Rice Equivalent Yield), gross returns, and system economic efficiency. 
### Insights
-  notes that SOC, availability of fodders makes the area more suitable (for jhum?) for cereals and pulses (edible seeds of legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, beans) and different livestock. From [[Das et al 2019.pdf|Das et al., 2019]]. 
- says jhum is not economically viable or sustainable due to reduced fallow periods which are driven by demographic pressures
- "Suitable IFS model comprising cereals, pulses, oil-seeds, vegetable crops, fruits, livestock unit, fodder crops, farm pond, and vermicomposting unit have been developed at ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Umiam for hills of NER of India to meet the diverse requirement of the farm household while preserving the re source base and maintaining the environment (Layeket al., 2023). "
- Small site, been managed as modern ag system since 1983
- Fairly intensive inputs (IMHO) and costs
- No 'controls' or contrasting information on jhum inputs/outputs
- "Besides this, crop diversification and livestock integration also enhance energy dynamics; and amalgamation of the agroforestry component (natural forest on the hilly slope) resulted in reduced environmental footprints and created a positive carbon balance, thereby promoting a green and circular economy."
