# [[Tamuli and Bhattacharya 2025|Eﬀects of jhum (shifting) Cultivation Fallow Period on Soil Physicochemical Properties, West Garo Hills District, Meghalaya, India]]


> [!tldr] Summary 4/5
> Longer fallow periods = increased silt and clay, organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.  Focused on western Garo Hills. 

> [!quote] Quotable
> Tamuli and Bhattacharya note that threshold fallow duration (7–8 years) is necessary to regain soil health and sustain productivity, oﬀering critical insight for sustainable land management practices in jhum cultivation method.


### Aim of Paper
See how different lengths of fallow period impact soil parameters, and ultimately determine minimum fallow period for restoring soil fertility. 
### Insights
- Soils in area:
	- topography is hilly mostly with some plains
	- soils mostly red gravelly and red sandy loam on the slopes and clayey loam in the plains
	- soils if hills are dep loamy skeletal to fine and excessively drained subject to slight to severe erosion hazards.
- Plots selected at various elevations with help of locals
- Basic findings
	- With soil chemical properties longer fallow = 
		- lower pH
		- increasing soil organic carbon. Range medium to high across all plots.
		- decreasing electrical conductivity
		- increasing soil nitrogen. Range medium to high across all plots.
		- increasing potassium and phosphorous (but not significant). Range low to medium across all plots
	- With soil texture properties longer fallow =
